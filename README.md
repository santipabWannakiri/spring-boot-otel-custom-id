## Introduction
To configure instrumentation for passing the context propgation, actually there are 3 way of difference at following
* Automatic Instrumentation
* Automatic Instrumentation with Annotations
* Manual Instrumentation

#### Automatic Instrumentation
In my previous [spring-boot-otel-context-propagation](https://github.com/santipabWannakiri/spring-boot-otel-context-propagation) POC project, I provided an example of automatic instrumentation configuration. It's really straightforward. We just load the OTEL library and the initial command, including setting the OTEL collector enpoint as the parameter environment. Then all the things will operate automatically. However, when the default instrumentation provided by the libraries or frameworks you are using is not sufficient for our specific use case or if we want to capture additional information that is not automatically captured by the existing instrumentation, manual instrumentation is the answer. It provides the flexibility to adapt observability to the unique requirements of your application.Â 


## Manual Instrumentation
As mentioned above, if default instrumentation is not sufficient or you want to capture something in deep detail, manual instrumentation is a solution. However, manual instrumentation is not easy to do. It's a really complex configuration, which I have summarized in the overview configuration step below:\
1.Dependency configuration\
2.OTEL Builder configuraion (Trace provider | Meter provider | Logger provider | Propagator)\
3.Acquiring a Tracer\
4.Creating Spans\
5.Context Management ( Context between classes and function | Context between services)

All of the steps above were ordered based on my experience, and most of them actually provide detailed configuration in the official OpenTelemetry document -> [Manual instrumentation for OpenTelemetry Java](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/instrumentation/).\
Therefore, I'm going to focus on context management because it's really important and harder to understand how you will maintain context and pass it through the whole service.


## Context Management
OpenTelemetry context (context) is a crucial component for distributed tracing and observability in microservices architectures. By passing the context through your service, you enable end-to-end tracing and ensure that contextual information is available for diagnostics and analysis. 

When implementing OpenTelemetry (Otel) manually, there are 2 primary contexts to manage:
* Context between classes and function
* Context between services


## Context between classes and function approaches
This refers to sharing context within a service, where different classes or methods might need access to the same tracing information.

Common approaches:
##### 1. Method Arguments : Pass the context object as an argument to methods that require it.

##### 2. ThreadLocal Storage : Store the context in a thread-specific variable for access within methods of the same thread.

##### 3.  HTTP Attribute : Use HTTP attributes to pass contextual information within the scope of an HTTP request.

Above are all the approaches that I can imagine; however, each has pros and cons. For this POC, I decided to choose the HTTP attribute, whose details I'm going to provide detail at following:

**Description:** Manage context as a bean and inject it into required classes.


| Approach               | Pros                                                                                                         | Cons                                                                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Method Arguments   | - Explicit Dependency: Clearly shows dependencies by passing the OTel context as an argument.                | - Parameter Passing Overhead: May lead to larger method signatures and require passing the context through all intermediate method calls.                                      |
|                        | - Modularity: Enhances modularity, making methods independent of global state.                                |                                                                                                                    |
|                        | - Testability: Improves testability as dependencies are explicitly provided.                                  |                                                                                                                    |
| **ThreadLocal Storage**| - Simplified Parameter Passing: Simplifies parameter passing within the same thread.                          | - Limited to Single Thread: May not work well in multi-threaded scenarios without careful management.              |
|                        | - Thread-Specific Access: Well-suited for single-threaded or thread-local contexts.                             | - Potential for Global State: If not managed properly, thread-local storage can introduce global state concerns.  |
| **Dependency Injection Frameworks** | - Centralized Management: Promotes centralized management of dependencies, enhancing modularity.           | - Learning Curve: May introduce a learning curve, especially for developers unfamiliar with the specific dependency injection framework.                                           |
|                        | - Simplified Dependency Handling: Can simplify dependency handling, especially in larger applications.         | - Potential for Global State: If not managed carefully, dependency injection frameworks can introduce global state concerns. |

Considerations:
Concurrency Requirements: If your application involves multi-threading or asynchronous operations, ThreadLocal might not be the most suitable choice unless managed with caution. Method arguments or dependency injection might offer better thread safety.

Simplicity vs. Explicitness: ThreadLocal can simplify the code by avoiding explicit parameter passing, but it might make dependencies less visible compared to method arguments or dependency injection.

Project Scale: For larger projects with complex dependency management requirements, dependency injection might provide a more scalable solution. For smaller projects, a simpler approach like method arguments or ThreadLocal might suffice.

2. Context between services: This involves propagating context across network boundaries, typically between different microservices or components in a distributed system.
* Crucial for tracing: Enables end-to-end tracing by ensuring all services involved in a request share the same tracing context.
* Primary approach: Inject context into outgoing messages (e.g., HTTP headers, gRPC headers) using OpenTelemetry propagators.

```java
void inject(Context context, @Nullable C carrier, TextMapSetter<C> setter);
```
The inject method is a key component in this process. It allows you to inject trace context into a carrier, such as HTTP headers or messaging system properties, facilitating context propagation.

* context: OpenTelemetry context containing trace context information. ex (Traceparent: 00-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef-0123456789abcdef-01)
* carrier: Carrier where the context information will be injected (e.g., HTTP headers, messaging system properties).
* setter: Implementation of the TextMapSetter interface responsible for setting key-value pairs in the carrier.
